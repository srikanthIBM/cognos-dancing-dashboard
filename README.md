# Cognos Dashboard for Live-Streaming of the Devices data in Manufacturing Unit.

In this Code Pattern, we will build a Cognos add-on to consume highly volatile streaming data, a dancing dashboard. 
The real time Dashboard will be able to display mix of data (volatile and non-volatile) can be shown on a single dashboard. Volatile data is extracted from external websites and in other words we are trying to build a Cognos add-on to consume streaming(Highly volatile )data like stock ticker or data from SCADA or IOT platform broadcast data. 
The idea is to build a dancing chart that captures volatile data and incrementally updates itself.


When the reader has completed this Code Pattern, they will understand how to:

* [Build Cognos Custom Widgets]
* [Integrate Java Script built Extension within Cognos Dashboard]
* [Display mix of Historical and Live Streaming IoT data in Cognos Dashboard]
* [Interact with widgets within the same Cognos Dashboard]

# Steps

Use the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button **OR** create the services and run locally.

<!--Optionally, add a deploy to ibm cloud button-->

## Deploy to IBM Cloud

<!--Update the repo and tracking id-->
[![Deploy to IBM Cloud](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/deploy?repository=https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot.git)

1. Press the above ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button and then click on ``Deploy``.

<!--optional step-->
2. In Toolchains, click on Delivery Pipeline to watch while the app is deployed. Once deployed, the app can be viewed by clicking 'View app'.
![](doc/source/images/toolchain-pipeline.png)

<!--update with service names from manifest.yml-->
3. To see the app and services created and configured for this Code Pattern, use the IBM Cloud dashboard. The app is named `watson-banking-chatbot` with a unique suffix. The following services are created and easily identified by the `wbc-` prefix:
    * `wbc-conversation-service`
    * `wbc-discovery-service`
    * `wbc-natural-language-understanding-service`
    * `wbc-tone-analyzer-service`

## Run locally

> NOTE: These steps are only needed when running locally instead of using the ``Deploy to IBM Cloud`` button.

<!-- there are MANY updates necessary here, just screenshots where appropriate -->

1. [Clone the repo](#1-clone-the-repo)
2. [Create Watson services with IBM Cloud](#2-create-watson-services-with-ibm-cloud)
3. [Import the Conversation workspace](#3-import-the-conversation-workspace)
4. [Load the Discovery documents](#4-load-the-discovery-documents)
5. [Configure credentials](#5-configure-credentials)
5. [Run the application](#6-run-the-application)

### 1. Clone the repo

Clone the `watson-banking-chatbot` locally. In a terminal, run:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/IBM/watson-banking-chatbot
```

Weâ€™ll be using the file [`data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json`](data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json) and the folder
[`data/conversation/workspaces/`](data/conversation/workspaces/)

### 2. Create Watson services with IBM Cloud

Create the following services:

* [**Watson Conversation**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/conversation)
* [**Watson Discovery**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/discovery)
* [**Watson Tone Analyzer**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/tone-analyzer)
* [**Watson Natural Language Understanding**](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/natural-language-understanding)

### 3. Import the Conversation workspace

Launch the **Watson Conversation** tool. Use the **import** icon button on the right

Find the local version of [`data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json`](data/conversation/workspaces/banking.json) and select
**Import**. Find the **Workspace ID** by clicking on the context menu of the new
workspace and select **View details**. Save this ID for later.

*Optionally*, to view the conversation dialog select the workspace and choose the
**Dialog** tab, here's a snippet of the dialog:

![](doc/source/images/dialog.PNG)

### 4. Load the Discovery documents

Launch the **Watson Discovery** tool. Create a **new data collection**
and give the data collection a unique name.

> Save the **environment_id** and **collection_id** for your `.env` file in the next step.

Under `Add data to this collection` use `Drag and drop your documents here or browse from computer` to seed the content with the five documents in `data/discovery/docs`.

### 5. Configure credentials

The credentials for IBM Cloud services (Conversation, Discovery, Tone Analyzer and
Natural Language Understanding), can be found in the ``Services`` menu in IBM Cloud,
by selecting the ``Service Credentials`` option for each service.

The other settings for Conversation and Discovery were collected during the
earlier setup steps (``DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID``, ``DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID`` and
``WORKSPACE_ID``).

Copy the [`env.sample`](env.sample) to `.env`.

```
$ cp env.sample .env
```
Edit the `.env` file with the necessary settings.

#### `env.sample:`

```
# Replace the credentials here with your own.
# Rename this file to .env before starting the app.

# Watson conversation
CONVERSATION_USERNAME=<add_conversation_username>
CONVERSATION_PASSWORD=<add_conversation_password>
WORKSPACE_ID=<add_conversation_workspace>

# Watson Discovery
DISCOVERY_USERNAME=<add_discovery_username>
DISCOVERY_PASSWORD=<add_discovery_password>
DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID=<add_discovery_environment>
DISCOVERY_COLLECTION_ID=<add_discovery_collection>

# Watson Natural Language Understanding
NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_USERNAME=<add_nlu_username>
NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_PASSWORD=<add_nlu_password>

# Watson Tone Analyzer
TONE_ANALYZER_USERNAME=<add_tone_analyzer_username>
TONE_ANALYZER_PASSWORD=<add_tone_analyzer_password>

# Run locally on a non-default port (default is 3000)
# PORT=3000

```

### 6. Run the application

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) runtime or NPM.
1. Start the app by running `npm install`, followed by `npm start`.
1. Use the chatbot at `localhost:3000`.
> Note: server host can be changed as required in server.js and `PORT` can be set in `.env`.

<!--Add a section that explains to the reader what typical output looks like, include screenshots -->

# Sample output

![](doc/source/images/sample_output.png)

<!--Optionally, include any troubleshooting tips (driver issues, etc)-->

# Troubleshooting

* Error: Environment {GUID} is still not active, retry once status is active

  > This is common during the first run. The app tries to start before the Discovery
environment is fully created. Allow a minute or two to pass. The environment should
be usable on restart. If you used `Deploy to IBM Cloud` the restart should be automatic.

* Error: Only one free environent is allowed per organization

  > To work with a free trial, a small free Discovery environment is created. If you already have
a Discovery environment, this will fail. If you are not using Discovery, check for an old
service thay you may want to delete. Otherwise use the .env DISCOVERY_ENVIRONMENT_ID to tell
the app which environment you want it to use. A collection will be created in this environment
using the default configuration.
